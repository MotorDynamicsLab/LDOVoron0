# Strain Relief Spacers
The strain relief spacers are designed to match the motor height of LDO specific motors. Check your motor and print the spacer that matches your model number: 
- use Strain_Relief_Spacer_36STH17 if you have a LDO-36STH17 stepper
- use Strain_Relief_Spacer_36STH20 if you have a LDO-36STH20 stepper

#Strain Relief 36STHxx
This is an optional mod by camerony that provides a stronger strain relief with better support.
